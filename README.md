## Exercise 3 - Reproducing an image

### How to get started

Click the "Fork" button at the top of the editor to copy the exercise.

### Exercise goal

Using JavaScript code, reproduce the original painting on the canvas above.

In the `index.js` file you have retrieved a reference to the parent element of your canvas - this is the `fakeCanvas` variable. From this variable you can start working on mapping the image. Good luck!

Remember - this is a science, so avoid shortcuts:

* don't modify the HTML code structure
* don't modify the CSS styles
* don't copy the original and paste it in place of the canvas ;)
